FOR FUTURE CHANGES

If you need to make some changes on the New horiseon web page:

    -First dowload the repository on you pc using the command  on GitBash  "git clone" using the URL.
    -Make sure to always keep the code, HTML and CSS clean and structured, following the same order for easy readind.
    -Always leave a comment on the new changes that you did.
    -Do not upload the new code if there is any broken link.
    -Try to keep any styling into the css and not the html, if there is too of it in the html it will quickly start to look messy.

    -I have restructure the html page for an easy reading.
    -I have fix the broken link the the "search engine optimization"
    -I have add alt for every image
